Space Power Open Source Project
Mission
To provide clean, affordable electricity to 33 million off-grid households as a continuous charity (Sadaqah Jariyah), enabling access to lighting, refrigeration, and internet in remote villages.

About Space Power
Technology: Nitrogen-based fuel cell using nanocatalysts (graphene + nickel) to generate 150-200W per unit.
Cost: $130/unit; $650 for 5 units (small house, 6-8 kWh/day); $780-$910 for 6-7 units (large house).
Applications: Powers lighting, fridges, fans, microwaves, and Wi-Fi routers for internet access.
Impact: Zero-emission energy, reducing 100-150M tons of CO2 annually.
How to Contribute
Develop nanocatalysts or fuel cells.
Manufacture units locally (target cost: $100-$130).
